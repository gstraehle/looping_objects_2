Looping Objects is some practice with d3.

Using the d3 library and jQuery, this one-pager lets you spin any number of circles you would like around a number of shapes at varying speeds.  The diameter of the circle is related to its speed, while colors are randomly generated after a completed circuit.  Every circle that completes a loop increments/decrements the timer, giving each ball a new speed after passing the starting point.
